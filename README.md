# Cancer_Rates_by_US_State

## About the Data
The U.S. states are divided into groups based on the rates at which people developed or died from cancer in 2013.
The rates are the numbers out of 100,000 people who developed (incident) or died from cancer each year.

## About the Project
The project involves creating two tables:

#### usc_death: This table stores information related to cancer death rates in U.S. states.
#### usc_incident: This table stores information related to cancer incidence rates in U.S. states.

## Queries and Analysis
The project includes a variety of SQL queries and analyses performed on the database:

- Retrieving data from the usc_death and usc_incident tables.
- Filtering data to retrieve records where cancer rates exceed specified thresholds.
- Sorting data based on death rates and incident rates.
- Calculating aggregate statistics, such as average death rates and maximum/minimum rates.
- Joining tables to combine data from both usc_death and usc_incident.
- Performing left joins to retrieve all records from one table and matching records from the other.
